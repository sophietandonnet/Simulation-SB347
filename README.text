Discrete population simulator
=============================

Population simulations were performed by running an in-house Python script.  Given an initial population, the rate of offspring production and the proportion of each gender produced by females and hermaphrodites at each time T, the simulator calculates the number of individuals of each gender and age.

The initial population is constituted of one dauer larvae. An iteration step of the simulator corresponds to 8 hours during which individuals “age” and produce offspring according to their gender and age.
